   "description":" Needleman-Wunsch is an algorithm for calculating optimal global alignment of two DNA sequences. All-pairs matching is represented by an NxM 2D matrix. Matrix cells are scored from northwestern-most to southeastern-most, depending solely on northern, northeastern, and eastern neighboring scores. Finally, the algorithm backtracks through the array to return an optimal alignment.  Note: This application was ported from the Rodinia Suite (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/).",
